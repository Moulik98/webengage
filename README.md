Subject: Request for Extension of Task Due Date

Dear Success Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I won't be able to meet the original due date for the task due to a family emergency.

I would like to request an extension of three days to complete the task. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I assure you that I will make every effort to complete the task as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and I appreciate your support. Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification.

Best regards,

Soumya Moulik
